*** Interactive CLI scipt to power ESXi VMs once ***

I made this script to ease my power on my development environments on my home server as i have environments with 5+ VMs.

the idea is to store my environment VMs in a file then i select one of the environments to power on .

so this script consist of two files one for the the script itself "environment_Control.py" and another "environments.json" where i store the environments names and related VMs IDS.

hope you enjoy it and learn me if we can make it more simpler or if you would like to add more features that statisfy your needs.
